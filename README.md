## More About Languge
This language takes advantage of Java and simplifies it. This makes Lazurite quite simple. Basically, the language is used to create games and applications, because it has powerful libraries for this. But on it you can make bots for social networks, work with files, and much more.

Hello World in Lazurite!:

```shell
print("Hello World!")
```
lsoup:
```cpp
using "lsoup"

lsoup.parse("https://artyomkingmang.github.io/lazurite-pages/")
result = lsoup.select("title")

print(result)
```

async example:
```cpp
using "async"
func hel(arg){
    print(arg)
}
async.supply(hel("Hello"))
```
std example:
```cpp
using "std"
func th(arg){
   println("My " + str(arg) + " Thread")
}
for(i=0, i<10, i++){
    std.thread(::th, i)
}
```
